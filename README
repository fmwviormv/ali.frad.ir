What is ali.frad.ir?
--------------------

It is my personal website, currently hosted on a VPS, using OpenBSD,
httpd, and FastCGI protocol:

https://ali.frad.ir/


Requirements
------------

The main target is OpenBSD httpd and native build infrastructure of
OpenBSD-CURRENT, but you should build and run it in any UN*X-like
Operating Systems.

You need BSD/GNU compatible `make' utility, C99 compatible compiler,
and following libraries: `libevent', `pthreads', and `zlib'.


How to build?
-------------

It is recommended to use an empty directory for build.

	$ mkdir obj
	$ cd obj/
	$ ../configure
	$ make


How to run?
-----------

Using OpenBSD httpd and OpenBSD, you need these instructions:

	# make install
	# ali.frad.ir
	# vi /etc/httpd.conf
	# rcctl restart httpd


Configuration for httpd
-----------------------

	server "*" {
		listen on * port 80
		root "/run/ali.frad.ir"
		fastcgi socket "/run/ali.frad.ir"
	}


Configuration for nginx
-----------------------

Use "/var/www/run/ali.frad.ir" as the fastcgi socket and the cgi root
directory.
